# Test: when the git root resolves to $HOME (or an ancestor), the sandbox
# refuses to expose it and disables git for the session, instead of binding
# the whole home directory. Regression for SANDBOX-FINDINGS.md F2.
#
# The threat: a user who has `git init`'d their home directory launches the
# agent from a subdir of home. `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` then resolves
# to ~/.git, so REPO_ROOT=$HOME would be exposed (read-only via REPO_ROOT,
# read-write via GIT_DIR) — leaking SSH keys, other projects, and the dotfiles
# repo's tracked-file history. The fix detects REPO_ROOT ⊇ $HOME and disables
# git, leaving CWD (the project subdir) fully usable.
#
# We drive this by pointing HOME at a throwaway git repo and launching from a
# subdir of it, so the guard fires without touching the real home directory.
